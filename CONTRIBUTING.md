### Coding Style

To maintain code consistency, we use clang-format with the following settings:

- BasedOnStyle: LLVM
- IndentWidth: 4
- ColumnLimit: 80

Please ensure that your code adheres to this style. You can format your code using clang-format before committing by running the following script:

```sh
chmod +x scripts/quality/format.sh # If the script isn't already executable
./scripts/quality/format.sh
```

Alternatively, you can set up your editor or IDE to format the code automatically on save. Refer to your editor or IDE documentation for instructions on how to integrate clang-format.
